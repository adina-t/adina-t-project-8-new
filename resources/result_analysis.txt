Analysis on the result:

Overall Trend:
    - At the beginning of each line, the line tends to go down a little bit, where each meet the minimum
      when the recursion limit is around 18, close to the "15" that we see in the modules.

    - The run time of smaller arrays doesn't get affected as much when the recursion limit increases.
      And as the array size increases, the slope gets steeper.

    - Since there are many factors affecting each run of our cases, there are noises in our graph that make
      the lines not smooth.

Zoom-in part:
    - From array sizes 1000,000 and onwards, there are obvious concaves down at recursion limit = 18,
      so that incidates the optimal value of recursion limit for array those sizes.

    - For array sizes from 40,000 to 70,000, there's an interesting concave downwards at recursion limit = 12.
      Since every test case were repeated only four times, it may be a conincidence that these array sizes turned
      out to have a lower run time at limit = 12, or that all run times at limit = 14 just so happened to be a
      little higher that cause the difference visually
